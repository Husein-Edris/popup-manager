Elementor Popup Counter
This JavaScript code is designed to manage popups on a website created with Elementor. It displays a popup every 3 days, but only if the user hasn't closed the popup previously. The code uses local storage and cookies to keep track of the user's interactions with the popup.

Usage
To use this code, simply add it to your website's JavaScript file or script tag. You may need to modify the code to match the ID of your Elementor popup. The code is licensed under the MIT license, so you are free to modify and distribute it as needed.
